#+title: Readme

For now this project is just in it's infancy perdiod
The plan for this application is to try out isometric projection to create a "map builder"
I'd like to be able to lay out tiles with a given height and floor (how high this x high element is placed)
I'd also like to be able to recognize which tile is being hovered by mouse and remove them
I'd like to be able to filter view based on "floor"

* Features
** Isometric tiling
By clicking add/remove/edit tiles that are at the coordinate of the mouse
** 2d camera movement
By using WSAD / arrows move around the map
** Zooming in/out
Using scroll / +/- zoom the view in and out
** Floor filtering
Being able to choose at which height we are currently editing
Also an option to not show tile below/above

* Possible extension features
** Import / export of the maps
Saving informating regarding the map in external file
** Randomly generate map
Generate location using perlin noise based methods
** Some textures and biomes
Could be cool to have different biomes and things that go on top of tiles and then randomly generate some locations in a manner simillar to minecraft
