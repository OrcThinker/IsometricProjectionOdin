#+title: Readme

For now this project is just in it's infancy perdiod
The plan for this application is to try out isometric projection to create a "map builder"
Built to understand isometric projection together with it's z sorting and see how it is actually may work in a game
Another reason is that this could be a good way to see how to make a tooling for map creating if I ever decide to create a game in isometric style (I had some thought regarding doing it)
Hopefully I'll have a tutorial attached to this particular application so that anyone can understand it and write their own isometric projection system for themselves in whatever language they choose

* Features
** Isometric tiling
By clicking add/remove/edit tiles that are at the coordinate of the mouse
** 2d camera movement
By using WSAD / arrows move around the map
** Zooming in/out
Using scroll / +/- zoom the view in and out
** Floor filtering
Being able to choose at which height we are currently editing
Also an option to not show tile below/above

* Possible extension features
** Import / export of the maps
Saving informating regarding the map in external file
** Randomly generate map
Generate location using perlin noise based methods
** Some textures and biomes
Could be cool to have different biomes and things that go on top of tiles and then randomly generate some locations in a manner simillar to minecraft
